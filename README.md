Welcome to the exciting game of Blackjack! In this game, there are four players, including the Dealer. The objective is to have a score as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it. Here are the key rules:

    1-Winning Condition: The player with a score of 21 or the nearest score to 21 wins the game. If multiple players have the same score and are closest to 21, it results in a draw called a PUSH.
    
    2-Losing Condition: If a player's score exceeds 21, they lose the game.
    
    3-Initial Cards: Each player, except the Dealer, starts with two known cards. The Dealer will have one card known to all players and one card face-down.
    
    4-Player Options: During their turn, each player has two options:
    
        •Hit: The player requests an additional card from the deck to increase their score.
    
        •Stand: The player decides not to take any more cards and ends their turn.
  
   To begin the game, please enter the names of the three players in the terminal. Once the names are entered, the game will proceed, and each player will take turns deciding whether to hit or stand.

Enjoy the game of Blackjack and may luck be on your side!
